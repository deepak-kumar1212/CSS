    <p>APIs are <section>ready-made</section> sets of <p class="class">code building blocks that allow a developer</p> to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building â€” it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, <span>and then put them together to make a</span> bookshelf. </p>
