    <h1>Before Div</h1>
    <div>
        <p>To make the effect easier to see, change the margin-right on your float to margin so you get space all around the float. You'll be able to see the background on the paragraph running right underneath the floated box, as in the example below.
            Once again, this is because the float has been taken out of normal flow. Clearing the following element won't work as it did before. This is a problem if you want the box to wrap jointly around the floated item as well as the text of the first paragraph that wraps around the float, while also having the following content cleared of the box. There are three potential ways to deal with this, two of which work in all browsers — yet are slightly hacky — and a third, newer way that deals with this situation properly.
